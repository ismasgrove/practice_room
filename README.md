# practice room

Where I solve the kind of problems present on programming challenges, problems that focus on algorithms, data structures and math. You might find some unorthodox coding styles here. I usually try to learn new coding techniques with these kinds of questions, so I might ignore the 'clever' solution and implement something wacky on purpose. Being told what to do is not a good learning strategy.

I don't really like investing most of my time solving algorithmic problems, but it's what I default to when I don't feel like working on anything else because I find them fun, they teach me to utilize my language of choice more, they teach me new techniques that make me more mindful of performance/efficiency concerns, and overall are just a good way to prevent yourself from getting rusty. Again, I might not update this repo frequently, it isn't exactly exciting to post solutions that are likely available elsewhere.

Considering all of my LeetCode answers are saved into my account, I will just link it [here](https://leetcode/ratpoison) (no shame in failed submissions!). This repo will only be updated with ProjectEuler and CodeForces problems.
