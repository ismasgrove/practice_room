# practice room

Where I solve the kind of problems present on programming challenges, problems that focus on algorithms, data structures and math. I'm not gonna bother to look for problems I solved years ago or anything I wrote on a browser window. I don't think this folder is importantso I will just update it every once in a while with whatever happens to be inside. Also, I like to solve problems without any code completion or linting. There's no reason behind it, really.

Here, you'll mostly (but not exclusively) find problems related to geometry. It's what I the most when it comes to problem solving considering how much I like graphics and visual stuff. I try not to really spend all of my time doing those problems, but I default to them when I don't feel like working on anything else. It's a way to prevent myself from getting rusty.

In addition, you might find some unorthodox coding styles here. I usually try to learn new coding techniques with these kinds of questions. Especially simpler problems. I'm always trying to find new ways to do things.

I think when it comes to problem solving, the first step is to solve the problem, and the second step is to implement it. So once I have mapped out a solution in my head, I'm likely to look for a cheeky way to implement it (I promise I won't do this in production code).
