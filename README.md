# practice room

Where I solve the kind of problems present on programming challenges, problems that focus on algorithms, data structures and math. I'm not gonna bother to look for problems I solved years ago or anything I wrote on a browser window. I don't think this folder is importantso I will just update it every once in a while with whatever happens to be inside. Also, I like to solve problems without any code completion or linting, and in C++, I consider it a nice way to learn how to utilize more of the language's features. 

In addition, you might find some unorthodox coding styles here. I usually try to learn new coding techniques with these kinds of questions. Especially simpler problems. I'm always trying to find new ways to do things.

I think when it comes to problem solving, the first step is to solve the problem, and the second step is to implement it. So once I have mapped out a solution in my head, I'm likely to look for a cheeky way to implement it (I promise I won't do this in production code).

I don't really like investing most of my time solving algorithmic problems, but it's what I default to when I don't feel like working on anything else because I find them fun, they teach me to utilize my language of choice more, they teach me new techniques that make me more mindful of performance/efficiency concerns, and overall are just a good way to prevent yourself from getting rusty. Again, I might not update this repo frequently, it isn't exactly exciting to post solutions that are likely available elsewhere.
